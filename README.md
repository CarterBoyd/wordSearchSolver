Word Search program in C

This is a word search program designed in C that was originally created in 2019 when I was first learning java.
Compared to the java version this one will be able to go diagonally making it a complete word search. The program
requires two files in the line arguement in order to work
[gridExample.txt](https://github.com/CarterBoyd/wordSearch/files/6844801/specExample.txt) is what the grid should
look like in order for the program to work.
[dictionary.txt](https://github.com/CarterBoyd/wordSearch/files/6844802/dictionary.txt) is an add on of a ton of
words, the size of the dictionary file will be what determines how long the program will run (it took 2 seconds
on my laptop when making this and using a 40 x 40 sized grid.
