Word Search program in C

This is a word search program designed in C that was originally created in 2019 when I was first learning java.
Compared to the java version this one will be able to go diagonally making it a complete word search. The program
requires two files in the line argument in order to work
[gridExample.txt](https://github.com/CarterBoyd/wordSearch/files/6844801/specExample.txt) is what the grid should
look like in order for the program to work.
[dictionary.txt](https://github.com/CarterBoyd/wordSearch/files/6844802/dictionary.txt) is an add-on of a ton of
words. The size of the dictionary file will be what determines how long the program will run. It took 2 seconds
on my laptop when making this and using a 40 x 40 sized grid.

This is what the profiler graph was able to look like with the dictionary file and a 40 x 40 grid
